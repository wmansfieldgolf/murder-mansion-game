Introduction:

Welcome to your very own terrifying murder mystery: Mansion Mystery.

I wrote this game taking inspiration from “And Then There Were None” by Agatha Christie, the board game “Clue,” and the viral video game “Among Us.”

The game is simple. You and 7 other players are in a house and one of you is a killer who is slowly preying on everyone else. Using contexts clues like missing weapons and who was in what room when, you must determine who the killer is before he or she kills everyone.

Players in game:
You (the user!)
Alexander
Clarissa
Kimberly
Jonathan
Michael
Lisa
Richie

Rooms and weapons:
Hallway - broadsword
Hallway Bathroom - None
Master Bedroom - None
Master Bathroom - None
Kitchen - kitchen knife
Dining Room - None
Living Room - fire poker
Garage - baseball bat					
					

Game mechanics:
Everyone starts off in the hallway of the house together. From there, each time the user inputs a new room to go to, all characters randomly move to a new room based on what room they are currently in.

Each room description will contain whether or not there is a weapon in the room, as well as who else is in the room with you.

If the killer ends up in the room alone with another non-user character, they will kill that character and leave their body behind. If the killer ends up in the room alone with the user, they will kill the user and it is game over.

To gather context clues, you can interact with the other characters in the room with you. Each character will tell you who was in their previous room with them, as well as whether there was a weapon in the room.

You can also use a notes function (by typing in notes) to keep track of who you think is or is not the killer.

Bodies will also be left in the room they are killed in… perhaps providing another clue to who the murderer is. 

If you think you know who the killer is, you can also type in accuse at any time which will allow you to make a guess as to who the killer is. If you guess wrong too many times though... you may be in trouble.

**Developer Comments**
- I am aware that it doesn’t make sense in real life for someone to pass through a room, notice a dead body, and not freak out about it, but for the sake of the game, the characters are very nonchalant.
- I also understand that people would actually notice each other as they passed into different rooms thus making it much easier to identify who the killer is. Maybe the lights are off and it's pitch dark? Use your imagination!

It's not a perfect game, but I am proud of it considering I have been programming for only about 2 months.

I hope you enjoy playing.
